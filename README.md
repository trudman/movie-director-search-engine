# Project Title: Movie Director Search Engine

## Description:

```
This project demonstrates the capability of linking two open-source APIs by first determining what the top box-office movies were for a given year 
and parsing who the movie's director was through the OMDB API, then performing a search of that director via the Wikipedia API.
```

## User Story:

```
As a movie producer, I am interested in learning what the top grossing box-office hits were for a given release year and finding who the director
was and receiving a link(s) to their Wikipedia page to learn more relevant information about he/she.
```


## Acceptance Criteria (Breakdown of Tasks):

* It is done when there is a combo/dropdown box listing the past 10 years to perform a search on movie release dates
* When I perform a search on the parameters above, then a list of the top 6 box-office grossing movies are displayed
* From the top 6 list of movies, the page displays the movie Title, the Year, the Genre, amount grossed at Box Office, Director, and [Rotten Tomatoes Score]
* After displaying the top 6 list of movies, a link is provided on the Director to show results from the Wikipedia API
